## Project Ideas 

This markdown is to describe potential final project ideas for Data Science 26.

**Project Idea 1: Predicting Game Success**

- I am planning to predict a game's success after launch
- I will use historic data (e.g. publisher / geolocation / month of release / number of players / online v. offline / sequel v. original, etc.) 
- I plan to get this data from online databases such as  gamebomb

**Project Idea 2: Predicting Esports Team Success**

- I am planning to predict a esports team's success in the upcoming year (similar to traditional sports team)
- I will use historic data of each individual player on the roster (e.g. # of wins, years in industry, age, race, etc.)
- I plan to get this data from online databases such as  liquidpedia

**Project Idea 3: Predicting User Churn**

- I am planning to predict a whether a user will become an engaged member of the Twitch community
- I will use historic data of "healthy" Twitch users (e.g. geolocation, age, gender, main game viewed, first game viewed, etc.)
- I plan to use internal data from work
